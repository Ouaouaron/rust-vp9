# Rust-VP9

I want to learn Rust, and I want to learn to use it for systems programming.
Implementing a video codec should be very visual, which will help debugging, and
it seems thoroughly systems-y. It also means I'll learn about video codecs,
which wouldn't be bad at all.

This will probably also contain some random tutorial code, then I'll work my way
up with bitmaps, jpegs, and so on, maybe even until I can actually do encoding
and not just viewing.
